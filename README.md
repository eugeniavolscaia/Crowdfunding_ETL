# Crowdfunding_ETL


This mini project was completed in collaboration with my partner -
Rebecca Saxon. It allowed us to practice building an ETL pipeline using 
Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions
to extract and transform the data. After we've transformed the data, we've
created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table
schema. Finally, we've uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

All extraction and transformation code is placed in json files. The 2 files
are slightly different. Also, there are 4 CSV files matching table names and
the schema png and sql file with table creation code.
